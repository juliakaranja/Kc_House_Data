## Description
There are number of success metrics in real estate agencies which include:

- Average commission per sale/ Sales in the agency

- Sold homes per available inventory

- Year to year variance on average sold price

- Year to year variance on sold average dollar per square foot

- Number of Days a property is on the market

- Average commission per sales person

- Number of properties advertised per real estate agent

We shall therefore use the data available to conduct an analysis guided by some of the listed success metrics above.

Our main aim for this analysis is to help the real estate agency to have a better understanding of the real estate industry in King county and to help them come up with realistic sales targets and better pricing models.

## Modeling
We used the following regression models:
- Simple Linear Regression model - Price vs Sqft_living
- Simple Linear Regression model - Price vs Sqft_above
- Multiple Linear Regression model - Price vs other variables

## Regression Results
The multiple linear regression model is better than the two simple regression models as it had a higher Rsquared value. This shows that categorical variables had a positive effect on the prices as illustrated in the univariate analysis.

Therefore adding these variables to the predictive model made the model to be a bit stronger.
## Conclusion
In conclusion the real estate agency should review the sqft of the living space/ the ground above the basement when setting their house prices as there is a linear relationship between these variables.

Factors like bathrooms, bedrooms, having a waterfront and an excellent view have a positive effect on the house prices. Lastly, the house prices seemed to have increased in 2015 they should therefore consider inflation when setting house prices in the future
